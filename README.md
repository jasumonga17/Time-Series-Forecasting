# Time Series Forecasting

**Problem Statement**: An airline company has data on the number of passengers that have traveled with them on a particular route for the past few years. Using this data, they want to see if they can **forecast the number of passengers for the next twelve months**.

In this project, I explored various time series forecasting models to predict the future values of our dataset. We implemented and evaluated several baseline models.

**Through rigorous evaluation using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), we compared the performance of these models across our dataset.** 

Our analysis revealed interesting insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses.
